    <h2 id="tribute-info">Here's a time line of Bardeen's life:</h2>
    <ul>
<li>1908 - born in Madison, Wisconsin, on May 23</li>
<li>1923 - entered the University of Wisconsin </li>
<li>1928 - received his Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering</li>
<li>1929 - received his Master of Science degree in electrical engineering</li>
<li>1930 to 1933,  went to work for Gulf Research Laboratories, </li>
<li>1935 - was offered a position as junior fellow of the Society of Fellows at Harvard University</li>
<li>1936 - received his Ph.D. in mathematical physics from Princeton</li>
<li>1938 - married with Jane Maxwell, a biologist who taught at a girls high school near Boston</li>
<li>1941 - 1944, headed the group working on magnetic mines and torpedoes and mine and torpedo countermeasures at the Naval Ordnance Laboratory</li>
<li>1945 - Bardeen began work at Bell Labs as a member of a solid-state physics group led by William Shockley and chemist Stanley Morgan</li>
<li>1947 - succeeded in creating a point-contact transistor that achieved amplification</li>
<li>1951 - began pursuing a theory for superconductivity and left Bell Labs, joined the engineering and physics faculties at Illinois </li>
<li>1956 - shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with William Shockley of Semiconductor Laboratory of Beckman Instruments and Walter Brattain of Bell Telephone Laboratories "for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect"</li>
<li>1957 - proposed the standard theory of superconductivity known as the BCS theory</li>
<li>1972 - shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with Leon N Cooper of Brown University and John Robert Schrieffer of the University of Pennsylvania "for their jointly developed theory of superconductivity, usually called the BCS-theory"</li>
<li>1991 - died of heart disease at age 82 at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts</li>
